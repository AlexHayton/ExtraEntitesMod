    <description>This is a mod to add some new Entites to Natural Selection 2 like a teleporter, a train etc.&#x0A;&#x0A;I added one test level called ns2_eem_test_level where you can see how to use the entities.&#x0A;&#x0A;Remember: The new entites will only work on servers that have installed this mod, on other servers your map will work, too, but the train etc. not (they&apos;re just not gonna be loaded).</description>
